## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11+  
- Streamlit â€“ Web app interface  
- LangChain & LangChain-Groq â€“ LLM pipelines & prompts  
- ChromaDB â€“ Vector database for portfolio projects  
- pandas â€“ CSV handling  
- python-dotenv â€“ Environment variable management  

---

## Customization

This project is modular and flexible:

- **Swap the LLM:** You can replace the default Llama-3.3-70B model with any other model, such as GPT-OSS 20B, by changing the LLM initialization in `chains.py`.  
- **Change the prompts:** Modify the email or job extraction prompts in `chains.py` to suit different use cases or email styles.  
- **Personalize user details:** Name, portfolio links, and formatting can be customized in the prompts, the `resource/portfolio_projects.csv` file, or in `app.py`.

These options allow you to adapt the pipeline for different portfolios, email styles, or LLMs without changing the core logic.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Sravya-T01/cold-email-generator
cd cold-email-generator

```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment inside your project folder:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add `.env` file in the project root with your API key:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=<your_groq_api_key>
```

---

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:

```
streamlit run app/main.py
```

2. Enter the URL of a job posting from a careers page (e.g., Nike, Apple).  
3. Click **Submit**.  
4. The app will:  
   - Extract job details from the page  
   - Query your portfolio projects based on skills  
   - Generate **personalized cold emails** ready to send  

5. Copy the email â€” formatting and links are recruiter-ready.
